TERRATRUTH set up instructions
Last updated May 1 2013
These instructions are incomplete AND subject to change! But hopefully will help. 
Terratruth was previously known as the AMN DSS (Aboriginal Mapping Network Decision Support System) so you may see references to amndss. 

Requirements:
linux server. Instructions assume Ubuntu Server
git (sudo apt-get install git-core)
apache2 (sudo apt-get install 
 - a2en RewriteEngine
pip
virtualenv
postgres

create user ecotrust - no password
add developers to the group sudo usermod -a -G ecotrust yourusername
clone the repo from https://code.google.com/p/terratruth/source/checkout

default location for the terratruth folder is /usr/local/apps

Set up location for image files. Default (set in settings.py) is
/projects/terratruth/rectified_images

Other things outside the repo: 
ln -s /tmp/user_shape_uploads/ uploads

File Ownership -- owned by ecotrust
su ecotrust

SET UP virtualenv
virtualenv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will test that django is working:
python manage.py runserver 

Could not find an easy way to install mapscript inside ENV SO:
sudo apt-get install python-mapscript

edit usr/share/proj/epsg to add 900913

set up webmap
var/www/webmap 

copy django_app/local_settings_template.py to local_settings.py and edit -- database settings

set up private map files in mapserver folder
