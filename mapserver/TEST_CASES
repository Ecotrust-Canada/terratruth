yyy
Using an external system, try to request a private WMS layer using amndss.cgi
Reason: amndss.cgi is accessible by the public but in running mapserver it provides the public mapfile which contains no private map layers.
https://amn-dev.ecotrust.ca/cgi-bin/amndss.cgi?LAYERS=Habitat%20Potential,Old%20Growth%20Management%20Area&TRANSPARENT=true&FORMAT=image%2Fgif&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&BBOX=-123.75,50.625,-123.046875,51.328125&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256
Expected Outcome: Fail
Expected Result: Image containing mapserver error, .Invalid layers given in the LAYERS parameter.

yyy
Using an external system, try to access mapserv CGI directly and specify your own mapfile
Expected Outcome: Fail
Reason: mapserv cgi is stored in the private folder of the cgi-bin directory so it.s not accessible except from the local machine.
https://amn-dev.ecotrust.ca/cgi-bin/private/mapserv&LAYERS=Habitat%20Potential,Old%20Growth%20Management%20Area&TRANSPARENT=true&FORMAT=image%2Fgif&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&BBOX=-123.75,50.625,-123.046875,51.328125&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256
Expected Result: 403 Forbidden . .You don.t have permission.. or something along those lines

yyy
Using an external system, try to specify the private mapfile in your map request using the public interface (override map get variable)
Expected Outcome: Fail
https://amn-dev.ecotrust.ca/cgi-bin/amndss.cgi?map=/usr/local/apps/terratruth/mapserver/amndss-private.map&LAYERS=Habitat%20Potential,Old%20Growth%20Management%20Area&TRANSPARENT=true&FORMAT=image%2Fgif&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&BBOX=-123.75,50.625,-123.046875,51.328125&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256
Reason: It is possible to provide the mapfile to use in your WMS request using the .map. variable, however the cgi.s both append their own 

mapfiles to use and the user-supplied one that then follows is ignored.
Expected Result: the public mapfile is used anyway and you get an error because the private layer you specified is not defined in that file.
